# The Rising Descent
The Rising Descent is an audio and visual reactive experiment which plays in the realms of illusion and uncanny. It is made of a continuous descending or ascending sound, which gives the audience the impression it never ends. Alongside this first auditive illusion, the audience can control some parameters through a digital interface and watch its visualisation, which reacts live to it in a mesmerising infinite loop. 
Developed in Max and visualised through TouchDesigner, this project approaches the Shepard Tone as a performative audiovisual structure rather than a purely sonic effect, staging endless ascent or decent movement as forms of enclosure in which repetition, ritual, and unease converge. By refusing resolution, the work remains inside the illusion, allowing nightmare logic to unfold through sound, image, and duration.
This repo is part of an experimentation using MaxMSP and Touchdesigner via localhost.
